### blockchain
Generic blockchain implementation in Haskell. Heavily inspired by Bitcoin blockchain, but does not fully comply to the Bitcoin blockchain spec. Published on [hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/blockchain), and used to implement a hacky-but-working test [blockchain-network](https://github.com/TGOlson/blockchain-network).
([github](https://github.com/TGOlson/blockchain))

### covid-viz 
Dashboard for various covid visualizations. Built during early 2020 to track outbreak data. Still functioning, but some pieces may no longer be up to date. Data from by Johns Hopkins CSSE.

## Writing
### Efficient Ethereum Smart Contract Storage
(medium)

Writeup on potential ways to optimize Ethereum gas usage (and in turn save $$$) when executing operations via a smart contract. 
### Other old stuff
(medium)

Other older (pre-2016) things Iâ€™ve written, available to browse on Medium. Some fun stuff in there.
